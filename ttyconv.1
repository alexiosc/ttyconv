.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBttyconv\fP converts a TTY session from one encoding to another. It
uses Python's fairly comprehensive collection of encodings, that leverage,
among others, the GNU C Library's
.BR iconv(3)
facility. This tool is useful when, for instance, you have a UTF-8
based system with national language and keyboard support and you still
want to connect to systems that are unaware of this, or use a
different (or bizarre) encoding. \fBttyconv\fP is intended as a means
of easing the transition from `legacy' (sic) applications to ones that
are fully UTF-8 aware without limiting their output to the US-ASCII
encoding, rewriting application code, or reconfiguring your system to comply
with legacy character encodings.
.PP
\fBttyconv\fP works by allocating a pseudo-tty, executing the
specified command on the pty slave (the `remote'), and then translates:
.PP
.IP \(bu
the command's output from the `remote encoding'
to the `local encoding', printing it to standard output.
.IP \(bu
the user's input from the `local encoding' to
the `remote encoding', writing it to the pty's standard input.
.PP
\fISHELL-COMMAND\fP is an ordinary shell command. The shell command
(including any arguments) must appear at the end of the \fBttyconv\fP
command line. If omitted, the value of the user's \fBSHELL\fP
environment variable is used to spawn a shell. As a last resort,
\fB/bin/sh\fP is spawned.
.PP
If the \fISHELL-COMMAND\fP contains command-line arguments that start with dashes,
prepend \fB--\fP before \fISHELL-COMMAND\fP. For example:
.PP
\f(CW
$ ttyconv -r CP851 -- ssh -C old.system.com
\fR
.SH EXIT STATUS
An exit status of zero indicates successful termination of the
translated session. A non-zero exit status denotes abnormal
termination due to an error that occurred while the terminal
translation was being set up.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBttyconv\fP accepts the following arguments:
.TP
.BR  -l ", " --local=\fILOCAL-ENCODING\fP
Set the local encoding to \fILOCAL-ENCODING\fP. The encoding must be
one of the encodings (or aliases of encodings) shown using the
\fB--list\fP options. If this option is left out, \fBttyconv\fP will
attempt to guess the value from the locale settings, if available. If
that fails, the local encoding must be specified explicitly.
.TP
.BR  -r ", " --remote=\fIREMOTE-ENCODING\fP
Set the remote encoding to \fIREMOTE-ENCODING\fP. The encoding must be
one of the encodings (or aliases of encodings) shown using the
\fB--list\fP options. This option is mandatory.
.TP
.BR  -n ", " --nolocale
Normally, the local terminal's locale settings are rewritten on the
`remote' terminal to declare the new encoding. For example, an
\fBLC_CTYPE\fP value of \fIen_GB.UTF-8\fP will be changed to
\fIen_GB.ISO-8859-15\fP. To take advantage of this, the system must
include support for this new locale. Specify \fB-n\fP to leave the
locale settings untouched.
.TP
.BR  -v ", " --verbose
Print out more informative messages.
.TP
.BR  -? ", " --help
List all available options and their meanings.
.TP
.BR  --version
Show the program's version.
.SH BUGS
This is an early version. Bugs are sure to be lurking within.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Not all combinations of local and remote encodings may be
used. Characters unable to be rendered are replaced by `?' in both
input and output. It is entirely the user's responsibility to ensure
the combination of encodings is compatible enough to provide a
workable environment. Data corruption in the terminal stream may well
occur, as many such combinations are not reversible.
